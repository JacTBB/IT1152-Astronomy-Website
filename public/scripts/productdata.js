        "brief": "",
        "desc": `Picturing Apollo 11 is an unprecedented photographic history of the space mission that defined an era. Through a wealth of unpublicized and recently discovered images, this book presents new and rarely-seen views of the people, places, and events involved in the pioneering first moon landing of July 20, 1969.

        No other book has showcased as many never-before-seen photos connected with Apollo 11, or as many photos covering the activities from months before to years after the mission. Starting with the extensive preparations, these images show astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin training for the flight, as well as the stages of the massive Saturn V rocket arriving at the Kennedy Space Center for assembly. They capture the media frenzy over the unfolding story and the "moon fever" that gripped the nation.
        
        Also featured here are shots of incredible moments from the mission. In these images, spectators flock to Cape Canaveral to watch the mighty Saturn V launch in a cloud of fire and thunder. Armstrong and Aldrin step out of the lunar module Eagle onto the surface of the moon. The command module Columbia splashes down in the Pacific Ocean, and the extraordinary voyage is celebrated around the world, and in the following decades.
        
        Most of the photographs were selected from NASA archives and the collection of J. L. Pickering, which is the world's largest private collection of U.S. human space flight images. The accompanying text by veteran space correspondent John Bisney details the scenes, revealing the astonishing scale and scope of activities that went into planning and executing the first moon landing. This book commemorates the historic mission and evokes the electric atmosphere of the time.`,

        "desc": `The long-awaited memoir of a trailblazer and role model who is telling her story for the first time.
        Eileen Collins was an aviation pioneer her entire career, from her crowning achievements as the first woman to command an American space mission as well as the first to pilot the space shuttle to her early years as one of the Air Force’s first female pilots. She was in the first class of women to earn pilot’s wings at Vance Air Force Base and was their first female instructor pilot. She was only the second woman admitted to the Air Force’s elite Test Pilot Program at Edwards Air Force Base. NASA had such confidence in her skills as a leader and pilot that she was entrusted to command the first shuttle mission after the Columbia disaster, returning the US to spaceflight after a two-year hiatus. Since retiring from the Air Force and NASA, she has served on numerous corporate boards and is an inspirational speaker about space exploration and leadership.
         
        Eileen Collins is among the most recognized and admired women in the world, yet this is the first time she has told her story in a book. It is a story not only of achievement and overcoming obstacles but of profound personal transformation. The shy, quiet child of an alcoholic father and struggling single mother, who grew up in modest circumstances and was an unremarkable student, she had few prospects when she graduated from high school, but she changed her life to pursue her secret dream of becoming an astronaut. She shares her leadership and life lessons throughout the book with the aim of inspiring and passing on her legacy to a new generation.`,

The inner luminous planet represents the hours while the outer luminous planet shows the minutes, all while orbiting around the central axis. The constellation-like seconds hand sweeps across the dial similar to comets streaking across the night sky and once every minute it aligns to complete the Trappist-1 star map dial.

The caseback features engraved 50th anniversary commemorative artwork of the Apollo 11 mission patch. The grille of the Trappist-1 resembles the Cupola and gives you a sense of looking out into space. Each of the twelve support bridges also doubles as an hour marker. The domed crystal is made from Hesalite that was originally developed for NASA.
        
        The straps are made from U.S. Horween leather which is ribbed and stitched to pay tribute to the articulated ridge-lines seen on space gloves. In honor of the year of the moon landing, only 1969 pieces of each Trappist-1 NASA Edition colorway will be made and each watch will be individually numbered.`,
